          "Going back to 1996, the Patriots are 5-1 SU and ATS at home against the Commanders, with the OVER going 4-2 in those contests. On top of that, the Pats are 7-3 SU in their last 10 preseason games.",
          "Additionally, taking a look at our preseason betting report, Quinn is one of the worst head coaches to back in August. He's just 7-16-1 across his two head coaching stints.

          "Deni Avdija of the Portland Trail Blazers and Andrew Nembhard of the Indiana Pacers are currently the betting favorites to be named NBA Most Improved Player for the upcoming 2025-26 NBA regular season.",
          "Here's an updated look at where Avdija, Nembhard, and all other contenders for the George Mikan trophy currently sit on the betting odds leaderboard at FanDuel",
          "2026 NBA Most Improved Player Odds",
          "Odds as of August 6, 2025 at FanDuel",
          "Avdija's first season in Rip City was far and away the most efficient of his young career, averaging highs in points (16.9), rebounds (7.3), assists (3.9), and steals (1.0). He ended up finishing eighth in voting for Most Improved Player this past season with a single first-place vote as a result, and is on pace for bigger and better production in 2025-26 with the recent departures of both Anfernee Simons and Deandre Ayton.",
          "He'll be entering his sixth season as a professional in the Association, and it's not unheard of for a player to receive this honor at that point in their career. Lauri Markkanen did so with the Utah Jazz in 2023, as did Victor Oladipo while with the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2018.",
          "The Indiana Pacers' front office has confirmed that Tyrese Haliburton will miss all of next season after suffering a torn Achilles in Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder. That's 18.6 points and 9.2 assists which need to be accounted for by the remaining core players, and oddsmakers believe Andrew Nembhard is the likeliest candidate to step up in Haliburton's absence, although backup Bennedict Mathurin isn't far behind on the leaderboard as of writing.",
          "Nembhard produced 12.5 points while converting 46.5 percent from 3-point range during Indiana's postseason run to the Finals, both of which were noticeable improvements over what he registered during the regular season. His defense remained superb against Oklahoma City's elite guards, as well, and now with Haliburton out of the picture, the 25-year-old Canadian will have more of a spotlight to showcase his offensive chops.",
          "The following teams have never had an NBA Most Improved Player winner: Brooklyn Nets, Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, Dallas Mavericks, Charlotte Hornets, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, and Sacramento Kings.",
          "When you visit your NBA betting site of choice, you’ll notice 2025-26 NBA Most Improved Player odds laid out like this:",
          "It's like a moneyline bet where favorites are shown by the minus sign (-) and underdogs have a plus sign (+). In this scenario, Deni Avdija is favored despite being at plus money. If you were to bet $100 on Kuminga in the NBA Most Improved Player betting odds and it hits, you would win $1100 – your $100 is returned and you would get $1000 in profit.",
          "If you were to bet on which player will be named Most Improved Player, you would make a futures bet.",
          "This is a bet made on events that will happen in time. In this case, it’s Most Improved Player. To make a futures bet, you would first use the handicapping info on this page to make your decision. Our Odds Calculator can give you an idea of how much you’d win based on the Most Improved Player odds and the amount of money you bet."

He ended up finishing eighth in voting for Most Improved Player this past season with a single first-place vote as a result, and is on pace for bigger and better production in 2025-26 with the recent departures of both Anfernee Simons and Deandre Ayton. He'll be entering his sixth season as a professional in the Association, and it's not unheard of for a player to receive this honor at that point in their career. Lauri Markkanen did so with the Utah Jazz in 2023, as did Victor Oladipo while with the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2018. 2026 NBA Most Improved Player Contender: Andrew Nembhard, Indiana PacersThe Indiana Pacers' front office has confirmed that Tyrese Haliburton will miss all of next season after suffering a torn Achilles in Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder. That's 18.6 points and 9.2 assists which need to be accounted for by the remaining core players, and oddsmakers believe Andrew Nembhard is the likeliest candidate to step up in Haliburton's absence, although backup Bennedict Mathurin isn't far behind on the leaderboard as of writing.Nembhard produced 12.5 points while converting 46.5 percent from 3-point range during Indiana's postseason run to the Finals, both of which were noticeable improvements over what he registered during the regular season. His defense remained superb against Oklahoma City's elite guards, as well, and now with Haliburton out of the picture, the 25-year-old Canadian will have more of a spotlight to showcase his offensive chops.

          "Pico, making his UFC debut, is a wrecking ball when he gets rolling. His combination of world-class wrestling, sharp boxing, and vicious body shots can overwhelm opponents quickly. He’s also improved his pacing in recent fights, blending takedowns with clean punching combinations.",

          "Murphy is a composed, technically sound striker who rarely takes unnecessary risks. While his measured pace can frustrate fans, it also keeps him out of danger. He’s incredibly hard to stop, with a knack for finding clean counters as fights wear on.",
          "The key for Murphy is forcing Pico into prolonged stand-up exchanges, where his defensive guard and accurate jab can shine. At +125, the moneyline has value for a fighter who’s never lost and knows how to neutralize aggression.",
          "While Pico is the more explosive athlete, Murphy is the more proven UFC commodity. Bellator crossovers — like Patricio Pitbull earlier this year — have struggled under the UFC lights, and Murphy’s steadiness makes him a live underdog. I like the value on the Brit to edge out a disciplined win."

          "With Jayson Tatum presumably out for the entire campaign due to an Achilles injury, the Boston Celtics have resorted to cost-cutting measures in an effort to get under the second apron and out of the luxury tax, including trading key members of the 2024 championship roster in Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis. Former Finals Most Valuable Player Jaylen Brown and All-Defensive guard Derrick White remain, but what surrounds them is an obvious lack of depth, especially if veteran big man Al Horford departs in free agency, as well.",
          "Boston has missed the playoffs only once since 2008, and while the Eastern Conference is relatively thin at the top of the standings, there's no guarantee its roster as currently constructed is good enough to land in the top eight, and that's saying something.",
          "Changes could still be forthcoming for the Toronto Raptors, but if the front office currently devoid of a team president following the dismissal of Masai Ujiri stands pat, there would still be much to be excited about north of the border. A Summer League team full of rotational pieces such as Ja'Kobe Walter, Jamal Shead, and Jonathan Mogbo advanced to the semifinals out in Las Vegas, Brandon Ingram will be healthy to start the season following his arrival ahead of February's trade deadline, and the three-man unit of Scottie Barnes, Immanuel Quickley, and RJ Barrett are all 26 years of age or younger.",
          "Teams ahead of them in the win-loss column like the Celtics and Indiana Pacers will be missing integral pieces, so a clean bill of health and the continued development and ascension of talent comprising the second unit will go a long way towards digging Toronto out of its \"rebuild\" and \"retooling\" to get back to the postseason for the first time since 2022."

Former Finals Most Valuable Player Jaylen Brown and All-Defensive guard Derrick White remain, but what surrounds them is an obvious lack of depth, especially if veteran big man Al Horford departs in free agency, as well.Boston has missed the playoffs only once since 2008, and while the Eastern Conference is relatively thin at the top of the standings, there's no guarantee its roster as currently constructed is good enough to land in the top eight, and that's saying something. Best bet to make playoffs: toronto raptorsChanges could still be forthcoming for the Toronto Raptors, but if the front office currently devoid of a team president following the dismissal of Masai Ujiri stands pat, there would still be much to be excited about north of the border. A Summer League team full of rotational pieces such as Ja'Kobe Walter, Jamal Shead, and Jonathan Mogbo advanced to the semifinals out in Las Vegas, Brandon Ingram will be healthy to start the season following his arrival ahead of February's trade deadline, and the three-man unit of Scottie Barnes, Immanuel Quickley, and RJ Barrett are all 26 years of age or younger. Teams ahead of them in the win-loss column like the Celtics and Indiana Pacers will be missing integral pieces, so a clean bill of health and the continued development and ascension of talent comprising the second unit will go a long way towards digging Toronto out of its \"rebuild\" and \"retooling\" to get back to the postseason for the first time since 2022.Most NBA Playoff Appearances By Active TeamsTeamAppearancesGames PlayedWinsLossesLos Angeles Lakers65782467315Boston Celtics62738423315Philadelphia 76ers54488251237Atlanta Hawks49390170220New York Knicks46404200204Detroit Pistons43372189183San Antonio Spurs39403222181Golden State Warriors38384212172Portland Trail Blazers37274119155Milwaukee Bucks37312152160Chicago Bulls36349187162Houston Rockets35322158164Oklahoma City Thunder34341170171Phoenix Suns33324160164Utah Jazz31292135157Denver Nuggets31245105137Washington Wizards3023799138Sacramento Kings3019483111Indiana Pacers29258123135Miami Heat26295163132Dallas Mavericks25249118131Cleveland Cavaliers25246131115Brooklyn Nets2417170101Los Angeles Clippers191536687Orlando Magic181406278Memphis Grizzlies14983860Toronto Raptors131235766Minnesota Timberwolves13793049Charlotte Hornets10632043New Orleans Pelicans9592237"

          "Projected win total betting odds for the upcoming 2025-26 NBA regular season have been released at several major sportsbooks, including our friends at FanDuel.",
          "Analyzing the current numbers for all 30 teams across the Association, here's where the greatest value currently resides whether you choose to lean towards an OVER or UNDER.",
          "Odds as of August 6, 2025 at FanDuel",
          "As of writing (August 6), the only team to have plus-money value for an OVER on their win total is the Los Angeles Clippers, who've spent the early portion of the offseason replenishing their roster with veteran talent in an effort to contend with the likes of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference. On top of James Harden re-signing on a two-year, $81.5-million contract, the front office brought aboard the likes of Brook Lopez, Bradley Beal after being bought out by the Phoenix Suns, a returning Chris Paul, and John Collins in a three-team trade with the Utah Jazz.",
          "Los Angeles won 50 games last season despite only having Kawhi Leonard for 37 appearances, and when the former two-time Finals Most Valuable Player was available, the team went 26-11. There's no denying the depth has improved, albeit with mostly aging players, but even so, if this is the Clippers' all-in bid to get to the Finals, then it looks strong on paper. As long as the core group can stay off injured reserve, then at least 50 victories for a third-straight year should be in the bag.",
          "An Achilles tear to Jayson Tatum during the second round against the New York Knicks set off a chain of events which took the Boston Celtics from a legitimate threat to capture a second title in three years to one which could struggle to stay above the .500 mark. Tatum will presumably miss most of, if not all of next season, and both Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday have been shipped off to the Atlanta Hawks and Portland Trail Blazers, respectively, in cost-cutting maneuvers. With Al Horford also having one foot out the door, this leaves Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, and Sixth Man of the Year Payton Pritchard to uplift a group with new arrivals in Anfernee Simons, Georges Niang, and Luka Garza, and the upside simply isn't there.",
          "Boston has all but waved the white flag, focusing primarily on getting out of the luxury tax and under the second apron. Even with the top of the Eastern Conference having wiggle room for teams to emerge, the Celtics now look tiers below the New York Knicks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Orlando Magic, and even the Detroit Pistons. The mighty have fallen and they've fallen hard and fast.",
          "When you check out a basketball betting site, you’ll see odds for team win totals displayed like this:",
          "The number beside the team name is its projected regular-season win total. In this case, it’s 58.5 for the Boston Celtics. If you think Boston is going to win 59 or more games, you would take the OVER at +100.",
          "A $100 bet would give you a payout of $200 – you get your $100 back along with your winnings of $100. Conversely, if you think they’re going to win 58 or fewer games, you’d take the UNDER at -122. That same $100 would give $181.97 – your original money returns, coupled with your prize of $81.97.",
          "Our Odds Calculator will show you what you’d get on a winning bet based on the odds and amount wagered.",
          "Although this may look like a totals bet because of the OVER/UNDER aspect, this is actually a prop bet because you’re technically wagering on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specific player or team milestone. In this case, the marker is the total number of wins being more or less than the oddsmaker’s set number.",
          "To get the best value on your NBA prop bets, take odds you like as soon as you see them. When oddsmakers set the lines, they could change as the season progresses and more games are played."

On top of James Harden re-signing on a two-year, $81.5-million contract, the front office brought aboard the likes of Brook Lopez, Bradley Beal after being bought out by the Phoenix Suns, a returning Chris Paul, and John Collins in a three-team trade with the Utah Jazz. Los Angeles won 50 games last season despite only having Kawhi Leonard for 37 appearances, and when the former two-time Finals Most Valuable Player was available, the team went 26-11. There's no denying the depth has improved, albeit with mostly aging players, but even so, if this is the Clippers' all-in bid to get to the Finals, then it looks strong on paper. As long as the core group can stay off injured reserve, then at least 50 victories for a third-straight year should be in the bag. Best UNDER Value: Boston Celtics, 43.5 (-108)An Achilles tear to Jayson Tatum during the second round against the New York Knicks set off a chain of events which took the Boston Celtics from a legitimate threat to capture a second title in three years to one which could struggle to stay above the .500 mark. Tatum will presumably miss most of, if not all of next season, and both Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday have been shipped off to the Atlanta Hawks and Portland Trail Blazers, respectively, in cost-cutting maneuvers. With Al Horford also having one foot out the door, this leaves Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, and Sixth Man of the Year Payton Pritchard to uplift a group with new arrivals in Anfernee Simons, Georges Niang, and Luka Garza, and the upside simply isn't there. Boston has all but waved the white flag, focusing primarily on getting out of the luxury tax and under the second apron. Even with the top of the Eastern Conference having wiggle room for teams to emerge, the Celtics now look tiers below the New York Knicks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Orlando Magic, and even the Detroit Pistons. The mighty have fallen and they've fallen hard and fast.   Claim Offer   NBA PromoNBA PromoNBA Team Future Odds   Claim Offer Terms and ConditionsNew customers only. Deposit min. $10.

In this case, it’s 58.5 for the Boston Celtics. If you think Boston is going to win 59 or more games, you would take the OVER at +100.A $100 bet would give you a payout of $200 – you get your $100 back along with your winnings of $100. Conversely, if you think they’re going to win 58 or fewer games, you’d take the UNDER at -122. That same $100 would give $181.97 – your original money returns, coupled with your prize of $81.97.Our Odds Calculator will show you what you’d get on a winning bet based on the odds and amount wagered.What Is A Prop Bet On NBA Win Totals Odds?Although this may look like a totals bet because of the OVER/UNDER aspect, this is actually a prop bet because you’re technically wagering on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specific player or team milestone. In this case, the marker is the total number of wins being more or less than the oddsmaker’s set number.To get the best value on your NBA prop bets, take odds you like as soon as you see them. When oddsmakers set the lines, they could change as the season progresses and more games are played."

He’s 18-3 NRFI and draws a Cleveland lineup that ranks below average in first-inning production. On the other side, Gavin Williams has a solid 16-6 NRFI mark and enough swing-and-miss to handle New York’s bats.",

Opposite him, Ranger Suarez has been just as dominant, going 15-1 NRFI with nine straight scoreless first innings.With both arms rolling and no glaring matchup edge for either lineup early, -130 is excellent value for this no-run first inning.

          "Highly-touted Blue Devils prospect Cooper Flagg is a member of the Dallas Mavericks after being selected first overall in the 2025 NBA draft back in June, and the expectations surrounding his inaugural campaign as a professional are immense. Sportsbooks such as BetMGM have already released props for how his rookie season will unfold, from the numbers he'll average to the probability of Flagg reaching specific statistical milestones in games.",
          "Here's a look at some of those props and whether or not the 18-year-old phenom is likely to boost units for bettors stemming from his production.",
          "<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->",
          "Odds as of August 6, 2025 at BetMGM",
          "Triple-doubles for rookies don't grow on trees, evident by the fact that only two manifested in 2024-25 and neither by a player drafted in the first round. Jonathan Mogbo (31st) of the Toronto Raptors and Keaton Wallace (undrafted) of the Atlanta Hawks each registered one, but it took until the last days of the regular season to make them a reality. Victor Wembanyama had two in 2023-24, one of which included blocks, while Amen Thompson snuck in with one during the final game on the schedule.",
          "This isn't to suggest that Flagg doesn't have the tools to pull one off himself, but the irregularity in which they occur paired with the Mavericks possessing so much veteran talent, many of which have made All-Star teams like Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, and a recovering Kyrie Irving, makes a triple-double for Flagg more unlikely than likely. With a fully healthy depth chart, Flagg would be the third option in the starting lineup at best, perhaps even fourth on some nights, so that doesn't equate to the ball being in his hands all that often compared to his days at Duke.",
          "That should also hinder his ability to drop 40 or more points in a game, something all rookies this past season failed to accomplish. Hawks forward Zaccharie Risacher did come close with 38, but from 2010 through 2024, only Wembanyama, Blake Griffin, and Anthony Edwards reached 40 points or more in their rookie year as a No. 1 pick. Scoring 50 points as a rookie is even more rare, having been accomplished only six times since 1965 and not since Brandon Jennings had 55 for the Milwaukee Bucks on November 14, 2009.",
          "Oddsmakers currently slotting Flagg's scoring and rebounding averages at 16.9 and 6.1, respectively, is perhaps underselling his individual talent, but it's once again indicative of the talent level on Dallas and the lack of need for Flagg to put up monster numbers out of the gate.",
          "Should his statistics hover around these marks, it would be the second-fewest points averaged by a No. 1 pick since 2019, beating out only Risacher from last year (12.3). Since 2000, only five non-centers (Kenyon Martin, Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, and Paolo Banchero) picked first have averaged better than six rebounds per game, as well."

          "Cincinnati has risen to as high as six-point favorites after head coach Zac Taylor announced on Tuesday that star quarterback Joe Burrow will be among the starters for Thursday's preseason opener. Taylor went so far as stating that the starters will play \"several series\" against the reigning champs.",
          "The Bengals sparkling form away from home during the preseason is likely another reason they're big favorites for this contest. After all, Cincinnati has gone 8-2 ATS in their last 10 road preseason games. However, before you go rushing to the window, be aware, the Bengals were underdogs in each of those games.",
          "Having said that, the Eagles have been brutal in the preseason under head coach Nick Sirianni going just 3-7-2 overall and 4-7-1 ATS. In fact, Philly is just 1-8-1 SU, and 1-9 ATS at home in their past 10 contests. Diving even deep, the Super Bowl 59 champs are 0-6-1 SU and 0-7 ATS in their last seven games as a home favorite.",
          "Taking a quick glance at the depth chart, both teams boast a plethora of intriguing backup quarterbacks. Burrow will give way to to Jake Browning and likely Desmond Ridder in this Bengals vs Eagles contest. While if Jalen Hurts suits up, the Eagles have promising backup Tanner McKee, the electric athleticism of Dorian Thompson-Robinson (who's started a handful of games for the Browns), and rookie Kyle McCord waiting in the wings. Plus, both teams have a ton of young talent at wide receiver, with players like Johnny Wilson, Terrace Marshall Jr., Charlie Jones and Jermaine Burton looking for a chance to shine. With both defenses likely to play a vanilla scheme in the first week of August, I'm on the OVER 38.5 points here. There's simply too much offensive talent on the field too ignore, especially if Burrow and the Bengals starters play multiple series against a hodge-podge version of the Eagles defense.",

See All Daily Promotions       Bengals vs Eagles Picks - Preseason Week 1Cincinnati has risen to as high as six-point favorites after head coach Zac Taylor announced on Tuesday that star quarterback Joe Burrow will be among the starters for Thursday's preseason opener. Taylor went so far as stating that the starters will play \"several series\" against the reigning champs. The Bengals sparkling form away from home during the preseason is likely another reason they're big favorites for this contest. After all, Cincinnati has gone 8-2 ATS in their last 10 road preseason games. However, before you go rushing to the window, be aware, the Bengals were underdogs in each of those games. Having said that, the Eagles have been brutal in the preseason under head coach Nick Sirianni going just 3-7-2 overall and 4-7-1 ATS. In fact, Philly is just 1-8-1 SU, and 1-9 ATS at home in their past 10 contests. Diving even deep, the Super Bowl 59 champs are 0-6-1 SU and 0-7 ATS in their last seven games as a home favorite. Taking a quick glance at the depth chart, both teams boast a plethora of intriguing backup quarterbacks. Burrow will give way to to Jake Browning and likely Desmond Ridder in this Bengals vs Eagles contest. While if Jalen Hurts suits up, the Eagles have promising backup Tanner McKee, the electric athleticism of Dorian Thompson-Robinson (who's started a handful of games for the Browns), and rookie Kyle McCord waiting in the wings. Plus, both teams have a ton of young talent at wide receiver, with players like Johnny Wilson, Terrace Marshall Jr., Charlie Jones and Jermaine Burton looking for a chance to shine. With both defenses likely to play a vanilla scheme in the first week of August, I'm on the OVER 38.5 points here. There's simply too much offensive talent on the field too ignore, especially if Burrow and the Bengals starters play multiple series against a hodge-podge version of the Eagles defense. Bengals vs Eagles Preseason Week 1 Pick: OVER 38.5 Points (-105) at FanDuel   Claim Offer   NFL PromoNFL PromoBet $5 Get $150 in Bonus Bets If Your Bet Wins   Claim Offer Terms and ConditionsNew customers only.

His submission game is lethal, and his cardio allows him to grind opponents down with relentless pace and ground control.",
          "While Dolidze is ranked slightly higher (#8 vs Hernandez's #9) and has never been finished in the UFC, Hernandez has all the tools to dominate over five rounds. Dolidze is tough and strong, but expect Hernandez to win minutes on the mat and slowly chip away at the Georgian’s defense.",
          "The best betting value is Hernandez to win + OVER 2.5 rounds at +100 — a sharp parlay for a fighter who likely wins by decision or late submission. Straight ML (-334) is parlay fodder, but this combo bet brings real value.",
          "Dolidze is a durable, gritty middleweight with solid grappling and brute strength. You can think of him as a caveman wrestling with flashes of explosive striking. He hasn’t been finished in the UFC and has pushed through multiple grueling decisions, showing off stamina and toughness.",
          "If you believe in the upset, the only angle is a straight play on Dolidze at +250. He won’t win minutes against Hernandez on the ground, but a sneaky reversal or a thudding shot could swing momentum his way. Still, his path is murky, and this is a tough stylistic draw.",
          "Hernandez has all the momentum, tools, and fight IQ to control this matchup. Dolidze’s toughness should extend this fight past the midway point, but the younger, more active Hernandez should pull away late."
